# elastic4clir
ElasticSearch package for Cross-lingual Information Retrieval

## Installation & Setup
Under this directory:

* index_research: all scripts for indexing and searching. Right now two datasets are included: TREC and CACM.
  And now we have Wiki_sw dataset ready for indexing and searching. 

* evaluation: all evaluation scripts.

* web: for future development. (ignore it for now, just for test and fun)
